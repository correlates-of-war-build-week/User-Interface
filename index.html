            <p class="article-open">We were able to work with correlates of war. They provided us with different datasets that touched upond different datapoints. The data provided was holistic and takes into account many factors. The collection of the data was done in a manner that we trust. You can find more information about the data if you visit this website.</p>

This included anything from removing datasets that were not relevant to cleaning up faulty data (which is expected in large datasets).</p>

            <p class="article-open">Once the data sets were cleaned the data scientists were able to run models that took into account all the relevant factors to determine the likelihood of war breaking out in specific regions. Anyone is now able to look at a country and see the percent of how likely it will go to war.</p>
