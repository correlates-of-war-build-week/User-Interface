            <h1>War Correlation</h1>
            <p class="top-one">Our focus is on determining what regions in the world are likely going to experience war.
                We take into
                account factors from the economics to the religion of a region. We will provide you with a percentage of
                how
                likely your region will be in war. </p>

                <h3> Data</h3>
                <span> We were able to work with correlates of war. They provided us with different datasets that
                    touched upond different datapoints. The data provided was holistic and takes into account many
                    factors. The collection of the data was done in a manner that we trust. You can find more
                    information about the data if you visit this website.</span>

                <h3>Filter</h3>
                <span> Our team of three data scientists were able to go through all the data and clean up the data so
                    that we would be able to work with it. This included anything from removing datasets that were not
                    relevant to cleaning up faulty data (which is expected in large datasets).</span>

                <span>Once the data sets were cleaned the data scientists were able to run models that took into account
                    all the relevant factors to determine the likelihood of war breaking out in specific regions. Anyone
                    is now able to look at a country and see the percent of how likely it will go to war.</span>

            <ol>
                <li>What problem does your app solve?</li>
                <p>Mitigating some of the drawbacks by providing predictability, i.e. getting resources deployed where
                    needed in areas of high likelihood of war. Also, knowing correlates of war can help policy-makers
                    enact policy to reduce the likelihood of war.</p>
                <li>Be as specific as possible; how does your app solve the problem?</li>
                <p>The problem we are trying to solve, is to create a model that gives an output of the probability/
                    risk that a region will be in war in a set amount of time (5yrs, 10yrs, 20yrs etc..)</p>
                <li>What is the mission statement?</li>
                <p>Using machine learning to predict areas with a high likelihood of war.</p>

        <p>"Preventing war is much better than protesting against the war. Protesting the war is too late." -Nhat Hanh
        </p>
        <p> Join us now on our mission to prevent wars from happening across the world. We believe that unnecessary wars
            can be stopped as long as we can properly anticipate where they will occur.</p>
